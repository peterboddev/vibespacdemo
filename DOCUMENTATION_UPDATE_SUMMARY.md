## Impact on Development Workflow

### For Existing Team Members
- Pipeline automatically triggers on push to main branch
- No manual deployment steps required for CI/CD
- Monitor pipeline execution through AWS console or CLI commands

### For New Team Members
- Setup scripts still available for local credential configuration
- Documentation provides clear status and usage instructions
- All necessary console links and commands provided

### Backward Compatibility
- All npm scripts remain functional
- Setup scripts updated but still provide value for credential management
- Documentation maintains comprehensive coverage for all scenarios

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check pipeline status
aws codepipeline get-pipeline-state --name insurance-quotation-dev

# View recent executions
aws codepipeline list-pipeline-executions --pipeline-name insurance-quotation-dev --max-items 5

# Manual trigger (if needed)
aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name insurance-quotation-dev

# View build logs
aws logs tail /aws/codebuild/insurance-quotation-dev --follow
```

## Next Steps

1. **Team Communication**: Inform team members about the active CI/CD pipeline
2. **Workflow Training**: Ensure team understands the automatic triggering on push to main
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure SNS subscriptions for pipeline notifications
4. **Documentation Review**: Team should review updated documentation for current procedures

All documentation now accurately reflects the deployed and active CI/CD pipeline status.
