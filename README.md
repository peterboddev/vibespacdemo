## AWS Infrastructure

This project uses AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for infrastructure as code. The infrastructure is defined in TypeScript and deployed to AWS.

### Infrastructure Structure

```
infrastructure/
├── app.ts                    # CDK application entry point
├── config/
│   └── environments.ts       # Environment-specific configurations
├── constructs/
│   └── networking.ts         # VPC and security group definitions
└── stacks/
    └── insurance-quotation-stack.ts  # Main application stack
```

### Network Security

The infrastructure implements security best practices:

- **VPC Isolation**: Database and cache resources are deployed in private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Database and Redis access restricted to VPC CIDR block only
- **Lambda Placement**: Lambda functions deployed inside VPC with single NAT Gateway for cost optimization
- **VPC Endpoints**: S3, Secrets Manager, and CloudWatch endpoints reduce internet traffic
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each component has minimal required permissions

### Infrastructure Components

The AWS infrastructure includes:

- **Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL**: Auto-scaling database with 0.5-16 ACUs
- **ElastiCache Serverless Redis**: Auto-scaling cache with performance optimization
- **VPC with Private Subnets**: Secure network isolation across multiple AZs
- **API Gateway + Lambda**: Serverless compute with comprehensive security and CORS configuration
- **Lambda Layers**: Shared dependencies with Docker bundling for production optimization
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure credential storage for database and cache connections
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Environment-specific log retention and monitoring

### CI/CD Pipeline Components

The CI/CD infrastructure includes:

- **CodePipeline**: Multi-stage deployment pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages
- **CodeBuild Projects**: Separate build and deployment projects with optimized configurations
- **S3 Artifact Bucket**: Versioned storage with lifecycle policies for build artifacts
- **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Automated alarms for pipeline and build failures
- **SNS Notifications**: Real-time alerts for pipeline events and manual approvals
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege security with separate roles for build and deployment

### Environment Configuration

The application supports multiple environments (dev, test, prod) with environment-specific configurations:

- **Development (dev)**: Default environment for local development and testing
- **Test (test)**: Staging environment for integration testing
- **Production (prod)**: Production environment

Each environment can be configured with:
- AWS Account ID (optional, uses current account if not specified)
- AWS Region (default: us-east-1)
- Environment-specific tags
- Resource naming conventions

### CDK Commands

```bash
# Bootstrap CDK (one-time setup per account/region)
npm run cdk:bootstrap

# Synthesize CloudFormation template
npm run cdk:synth

# Show differences between deployed stack and current code
npm run cdk:diff

# Deploy the stack
npm run cdk:deploy

# Synthesize and automatically deploy on success (recommended for development)
npm run cdk:synth-and-deploy

# Destroy the stack (use with caution)
npm run cdk:destroy
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Commands ✅ PIPELINE DEPLOYED

The CI/CD pipeline is already deployed and active:

- **Pipeline Name**: insurance-quotation-dev
- **Status**: Active and monitoring GitHub repository
- **Automatic Triggering**: Enabled on push to main branch

```bash
# Monitor pipeline status
aws codepipeline get-pipeline-state --name insurance-quotation-dev

# View recent executions
aws codepipeline list-pipeline-executions --pipeline-name insurance-quotation-dev --max-items 5

# Manual trigger (if needed)
aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name insurance-quotation-dev

# View build logs
aws logs tail /aws/codebuild/insurance-quotation-dev --follow
```

**Pipeline Management Commands** (for updates):
```bash
# Show CI/CD pipeline differences
npm run cicd:diff

# Update CI/CD pipeline
npm run cicd:deploy

# Synthesize CI/CD pipeline
npm run cicd:synth
```

### Automated Deployment

The project supports automated deployment after successful CDK synthesis for streamlined development:

```bash
npm run cdk:synth-and-deploy
```

This command will:
1. Run CDK synthesis to validate the infrastructure code
2. If synthesis succeeds, automatically deploy to the development environment
3. Show deployment progress and outputs
4. Complete in a single command without manual intervention

This eliminates the need to manually run deploy after each successful synthesis, making the development workflow more efficient.

### Environment Variables

#### CDK Deployment Variables
You can override default configurations using environment variables:

- `ENVIRONMENT`: Target environment (dev, test, prod)
- `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`: AWS Account ID
- `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`: AWS Region
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: AWS Region (alternative)

#### Lambda Runtime Variables
Lambda functions require these environment variables (automatically set by CDK):

- `REDIS_SECRET_ARN`: ARN of the Redis connection secret in AWS Secrets Manager
- `REDIS_ENDPOINT`: ElastiCache Serverless Redis endpoint
- `REDIS_PORT`: Redis port (default: 6379)
- `REDIS_SSL`: Enable SSL/TLS for Redis connections (default: true)
- `DB_SECRET_ARN`: ARN of the database connection secret
- `DB_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT`: Aurora PostgreSQL cluster endpoint
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for service connections

### Credential Setup ✅ COMPLETED

GitHub integration and CI/CD credentials are already configured:

**Repository Configuration**:
- **Repository**: `peterboddev/vibespacdemo`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Owner**: `peterboddev`
- **URL**: https://github.com/peterboddev/vibespacdemo
- **GitHub Token**: Stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Webhook**: Active and configured for automatic pipeline triggering

**For new team members**, set up local credentials:

```bash
# Setup Git credentials (Linux/Mac)
npm run setup:credentials-bash

# Setup Git credentials (Windows)
npm run setup:credentials
```

The credential setup process:
1. Creates `.git-credentials` from template
2. Prompts you to fill in GitHub token and repository information
3. Configures AWS account information for local development
4. Provides instructions for sourcing credentials in your shell

### Bootstrap Setup

Before deploying, you need to bootstrap CDK in your AWS account:

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run cdk:bootstrap

# Or manually with specific environment
ENVIRONMENT=prod npm run cdk:bootstrap

# Or using PowerShell directly
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bootstrap-cdk.ps1 -Environment prod -Region us-west-2
```

The bootstrap process:
1. Verifies AWS CLI and CDK installation
2. Gets your AWS account ID automatically
3. Creates necessary CDK resources in your AWS account
4. Configures deployment permissions

### Deployment

Deploy to different environments:

```bash
# Deploy to development (default)
npm run cdk:deploy

# Deploy to test environment
cdk deploy --context environment=test

# Deploy to production
cdk deploy --context environment=prod
```
