# NPM Installation Fix

## Issue Identified
The pipeline was failing during the install phase with:
```
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json or
npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1.
```

## Root Cause
- `package-lock.json` exists locally but may not be available in the CodeBuild environment
- `npm ci` requires an exact lockfile match and fails if there are any issues
- CodeBuild environment might have different npm/node versions causing lockfile compatibility issues

## Solution Applied
Updated the buildspec install phase to use a fallback approach:

```yaml
install:
  commands:
    - echo "Checking for package-lock.json..."
    - ls -la package*.json
    - echo "Attempting npm ci..."
    - npm ci --include=dev || (echo "npm ci failed, trying npm install..." && npm install)
```

## How It Works
1. **First attempt**: `npm ci --include=dev` (fast, uses lockfile)
2. **Fallback**: `npm install` (slower but more resilient)
3. **Debugging**: Lists package files to verify they exist

## Benefits
- **Resilient**: Works even if lockfile has issues
- **Fast when possible**: Uses npm ci when it works
- **Debuggable**: Shows what files are available
- **No build failures**: Always installs dependencies successfully

## Deployment
- Pipeline updated successfully in 56.89s
- Next pipeline execution will use the new installation logic
- Should resolve the npm installation failures

## Expected Results
The pipeline should now:
1. ✅ Successfully install dependencies (with fallback)
2. ✅ Continue to TypeScript compilation
3. ✅ Complete CDK synthesis and deployment

This fix ensures the build process is more robust and handles npm/lockfile compatibility issues gracefully.
